<p>Hello!<br> I am Adyan Durrani a current year 12 student studying mathamatics, physics and computer science 
as A-Levels at a sixth form in Greater London. I am interested in electronics, programing and anything that involves
 putting things together. Through my own research, I have expanded my knowledge of electronic components, their functions 
 and how they can be applied. I have built a number of projects on breadboards such as creating logic gates with transistors;
a servo motor controlled claw that is controlled by a distance sensor and an arduino; a flashlight (:/), and much more. 
<br><br>
I am also the bass player for the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AceirBand"> Aceir</a>. This band is my creative outlet.
writing music is the method I use in order to express how I feel to others. We're pretty cool I think. You should check us out.
