<p>Hello!<br> I am Adyan Durrani a current year 12 student studying mathamatics, physics and computer science 
as A-Levels at a sixth form in Greater London. I am interested in electronics, programing and anything that involves
 putting things together. Through my own research, I have expanded my knowledge of electronic components, their functions 
 and how they can be applied. I have built a number of projects on breadboards such as creating logic gates with transistors;
a servo motor controlled claw that is controlled by a distance sensor and an arduino; a flashlight (:/), and much more. 
<br><br>
I am also the bass player for the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AceirBand" target="_blank"> Aceir</a>. We're pretty cool I think. You should check us out. But I warn you, you won't be able to hear anything but the drums.
<br><br>
    here are a few things a find cool: music, electronics, the half-life and portal franchises, sterolab, puzzle games and probably some other stuff that I can't think of right now.
    <br><br>
    (here's a link to my main music playlist if you want to hear it, <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/adyan/pl.u-zPyLLEvC8rqrp9N" target = "_blank">playlist</a>, aparently I have the worst music taste out of all my friends. So keep your expextations low!!)
