<h2>Hello!<br> I am Adyan Durrani a current year 12 student studying mathamatics, physics and computer science 
as A-Levels at a sixth form in Greater London. I am interested in electronics, programing and anything that involves putting things together.
I have completed a course with the title <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/an-introduction-electronics/">'An introduction to electronics'</a>
on OpenLearn (Statement of participation pictured on the right). Throughout the course I learned how to manipulate voltages, current and resistances in 
electronic circuts through the use of voltage dividers and operational amps. Through my own research, I have expanded my knowledge of
electronic components, their functions and how they can be applied. I have built a number of projects on breadboards such as creating logic gates with transistors;
a solenoid motor controlled claw that is controlled by a distance sensor and an arduino; a flashlight, and much more. 
<br><br>
I am also the bass player for the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AceirBand"> Aceir</a>. This band is my creative outlet.
writing music is the method I use in order to express how I feel to others. Working with my bandmates has taught me to be
patient, understanding and verbal as we don't always agree on everything.
