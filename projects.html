<h2>Set release latch using transistors</h2>
<p> 03/10/23: I have decided to start this project to test out how transistors work. I drew up a sketch of the S-R latch using
logic gates(<a href="https://imgur.com/u0iN2nV">here</a>).
<br>Now I've drawn out each individual logic gate using transistors (<a href="https://imgur.com/N66Gxan">here</a>)... Not entirely sure how to connect them together yet but we'll get there.<br />
Okay, okay I think I got it... oh wait nvm... Oh... hmmm... Ive taken apart and put it back together like 5 times im starting to think I might be the problem
but we must move and conintue until the end!!<br /> Okay, so. The problem. I've been connecting the emmitter some of the transistors to the emmitter of others which I now think is a big nono. I'll take a break for a bit and work on it tomorrow.</p>
<p>
6/10/23: I tried showing the breadboard to my computer science teacher who couldn’t help and to my physics teacher
 who also couldn’t help but he pointed me in the direction of someone who he thought could help, but he couldn’t also… :/
</p><p>
7/10/23: After doing lots and I mean lots of school work I think I’ve finally found time to try to fix my problem today<br> Oh ok cool. There’s another way 
to draw out an S-R latch using logic gates.<br> here we go: an S-R latch using NOR gates (<a href="https://imgur.com/3DJVEIZ">here</a>). I’ve shoved all my electronics part into a corner somewhere to “clean” my desk but I’ll try
 to put it together physically tomorrow (or whenever I have time) </p>
 
 <h2>Robotic finger thingy?</h2>
<p> 30/09/23: From the depths of my brain I finally remembered that I thought of this, it’s been a thought for months, 
but now is the time! Not entirely sure on how to describe what this is but I’ll try. It’s a skinny piece of  card on the
 end of a cardboard tube, the card thing can kinda bend like a finger due to a string attached to the top of it which goes 
 through the tube and connects the a servo motor which bends it . Or at least that’s the plan. Here is a <a href="https://imgur.com/HmAAXSe">little schematic 
 of the geezer.</a> (If I didn’t make sense here please email me at: adyandurr@gmail.com writing things are not my strong suit…
 do not ask about my English language GCSE… we don’t talk about that. OKAY!) Anyways, I’ve sourced a long cardboard tube from 
 an empty roll of plastic wrap it’s nice and sturdy and should be a good length. And I have ordered a servo motor off of eBay 
 (3 BLOODY POUNDS!!! Unbelievable!) and also an ultrasonic distance sensor to see if I can make the grip(?) of the claw increase 
 as an object moves closer to it… but we’ll do that later. For now let’s just get the basics working.</p><p>

6/10/23: FINALLY, the servo arrived (remember this cost me 3 pounds!!! Still mad about this. If you know anywhere I can but parts
 for cheaper please email me.) now time to put it together. <br>
It’s a bit ugly looking… (<a href = "https://imgur.com/cEAoXHf">here</a>). I kinda just glue-tacked the servo on idek how else to put it on… TAPE, I could use tape… nvm 
that would leave a residue and I don’t want to tarnish my brand-new (3 pounds!) servo motor. Okay, now time to wire it up and 
write some code on my arduino UNO rev 3, I bought it a month ago and I think it’s amazing there should be a new one releasing soon
 which looks sick! It’s got like SMD LEDs on it, I have no idea what I would even use the LEDs for but it’s cool and it’s got wifi
 on the base model and it’s like 4x faster than my lousy rev 3 in every conceivable way, but hey Christmas isn’t too far away 
 hehehe. ANYWAYS, code, it’s been a bit since I’ve written in c++ (arduino edition) but it should be like riding a bike, you’ll 
 never forget. <br> okay code written, let’s see how it runs… !? Servos can only turn 180 degrees!! What is this madness! 
 I’ll have to move the servo and physically up try again… it’s pretty late though and I’ve got to be up early tomorrow so we’ll 
 continue another time.</p>
